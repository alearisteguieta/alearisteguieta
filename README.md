## About me
I blend creative leadership with deep prompt engineering and generative-AI strategy. I design high-impact prompts, guide AI-driven projects from concept to delivery, and help teams use LLMs to solve product and business problems. My approach is interdisciplinary ‚Äî combining creative thinking, product sense, and quantitative curiosity.

Current roles
- Creative Director & AI Strategist ‚Äî Vidu AI
- Prompt Engineering Intern ‚Äî Zetheta Algorithms Private Limited

Core focus areas
- Prompt design, iteration, and evaluation for LLMs
- Generative AI product strategy and creative direction
- FinTech-focused prompt solutions and data-driven prototyping

## Skills
- Prompt Engineering ‚Ä¢ Generative AI ‚Ä¢ LLMs (text + multimodal)  
- Creative Direction ‚Ä¢ Product & Project Leadership  
- Prototyping ‚Ä¢ Experimentation ‚Ä¢ Quantitative thinking

## Featured project
### Prompt-Engineering-FinTech-FPF
Repository: https://github.com/alearisteguieta/Prompt-Engineering-FinTech-FPF

A focused collection of prompt patterns, experiments, and templates applied to FinTech use cases ‚Äî trading workflows, analytics, and finance-oriented assistant design. It showcases practical examples of prompt structuring, evaluation notes, and reproducible experiments.

Highlights
